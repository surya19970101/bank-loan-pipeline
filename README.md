# Credit Risk Prediction Pipeline (GCP BigQuery + Dataflow)

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a scalable data pipeline on **Google Cloud Platform** for credit risk prediction.
It uses:
- **BigQuery** for data storage and transformations
- **Dataflow** for ETL
- **Python** for preprocessing & modeling
- **Looker Studio** for visualization
