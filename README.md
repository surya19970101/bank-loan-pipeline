# Credit Risk Prediction Pipeline (GCP BigQuery + Dataflow)

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a scalable data pipeline on **Google Cloud Platform** for credit risk prediction.
It uses:
- **BigQuery** for data storage and transformations
- **Dataflow** for ETL
- **Python** for preprocessing & modeling
- **Looker Studio** for visualization

---

## Dataset
Source: [Kaggle Credit Risk Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
Uploaded to **GCS Bucket** for pipeline ingestion.

## Folder Structure

## Day 2 Progress
- Created Cloud Storage bucket for raw data
- Created BigQuery dataset for credit risk analysis
- Built initial GCS â†’ BigQuery Python pipeline

## Project Progress

Step 1: Dataset selected (Credit Risk dataset from Kaggle)
Step 2: Data uploaded to Google Cloud Storage and ingested into BigQuery
Step 3: Transformation layer setup (dbt/SQL workflows)
Step 4: Orchestration pipeline (Cloud Composer/Airflow)
Step 5: Visualization and final outputs

## Step 1 and Step 2 done.
